Student Performance Predictor
Overview
This project is a comprehensive machine-learning pipeline designed to forecast student performance based on factors such as parental education levels, lunch type, demographic background, and academic scores in reading and writing. The repository includes data exploration, model training, and a web application built with Flask for interactive predictions. The codebase is organized for clarity and maintainability and is deployed using AWS services like Elastic Beanstalk and CodePipeline.

Project Structure
notebook/: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development.
src/: Houses code for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
templates/: HTML templates for the user interface of the web app.
app.py: Main script for running the Flask application.
requirements.txt: List of project dependencies.
setup.py: Configuration script for setting up the project package.
Tools and Technologies
Python: Primary programming language.
Pandas and NumPy: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Used for creating visualizations and data insights.
Scikit-learn: Powers the machine learning models.
